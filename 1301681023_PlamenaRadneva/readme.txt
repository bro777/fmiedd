﻿Book Manager: A simple system to manage book records in a database

A project by: Plamena Radneva (rhythmxholic@gmail.com)

SUMMARY:
	* Should work with Visual Studio 2010 - 2013 (possible breakdowns though)
	* A WinForms - based project, implementing simple CRUD using Access DB
	* Four forms to operate with
	* Five data attributes for a single DB record (book): id, title, author, price and ISBN

DESCRIPTION:
	1) Functions/Forms:
		* When running the project, the first form you see is called BookManager which has the duty of
		a splash screen and can only redirect to the other 3 forms described below;
		* View All Books (a.k.a. ViewAll form)- Consits of a lame table (build using labels because VS 2013 didn't provide me with a Line Shape Tool :/ )
		where all the present data is going to be displayed by clicking the View button;
		* Find/Edit/Delete Book (a.k.a. FindBook form) - User can search only by book title and can change details about the record.
		Also, user can input any string for price and ISBN because I was too lazy to make dinput data check. Also, it can
		only retrieve one record at a time;
		* Add Book (a.k.a. AddBook form) - Speaks for itself, its function is to allow the user to add new records to the DB.
		User can add only one record at a time. Has some "amazing" input data check.
	2) Additional classes:
		* BookEntity class - "Storage" class consisting of only properties used in retrieving the data from the DB;
		* ViewLabel class - A user-defined class which overrides the hardcoded Label class. This one is used
		for displaying the data in the ViewAll form.

* Notes: 
	- Please read the comments in the models and controllers folders first in order to understand the whole project;
	- The database used for this project is named 'library.mdb' and can be found in the bin\Debug folder of the project

INSTRUCTIONS:
	 1) Start the solution (.sln-file) called '1301681023_PlamenaRadneva' in the folder with the same name
	 2) Break the project :)
